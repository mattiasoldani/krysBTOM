This is the source code of **krysB**eam**T**est **O**nline **M**onitor, an online data monitor for the ELIOT/STORM team experimental studies on the electromagnetic interactions between high-energy particles and oriented crystalline lattices that are performed at many high-energy particle beam facilities worldwide. This software is meant to perform the real-time data analysis of the collected data and to publish the results on [the krysBTOM webpage](https://msoldani.web.cern.ch/krysBTOM/). Details on how it works can be found [here](https://msoldani.web.cern.ch/krysBTOM/about/).
